The PlantVillage dataset consists of 54303 healthy and unhealthy leaf images divided into 38 categories by species and disease.
TensorFlow provides direct support for the PlantVillage dataset, enabling easy integration into TensorFlow-based models. https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village.
The images span 14 crop species: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato. 
In containes images of 17 fungal diseases, 4 bacterial diseases, 2 mold (oomycete) diseases, 2 viral disease, and 1 disease caused by a mite. 
12 crop species also have images of healthy leaves that are not visibly affected by a disease.

about the paper - 
Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people.
Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. 
However, the fact that the global food supply is annually reduced by an average of 40% (Oerke 2006) demonstrates that our collective battle against diseases and pests of crop plants is not won.
